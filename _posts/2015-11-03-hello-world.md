Hello there!

Inspired by this blog post, [Blog Little Things](http://coffeecoder.net/blog/blog-little-things/), that says...

> "...don’t fear to **blog little things**. It doesn’t need to be big, significant, detailed, mind-blowing to come out but just of a little value. It is helpful to think just of one person who had the exact same problem as yours and was helped by your post."

I have decided to do what the post advises and blog little things that I feel would be helpful to readers.
